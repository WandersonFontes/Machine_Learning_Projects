# :grapes: Wines :wine_glass:
### This project was developed with the aim of using a model to identify the type of wines.

#### :dart: Problem 
>Identify the types of wine in a dataset of more than 6000 lines

#### :card_file_box: Get Dataset 
[![Dataset](https://cdn-icons.flaticon.com/png/128/917/premium/917806.png?token=exp=1634056529~hmac=7c188db1eb1b8f821208da8c262b998e)](https://www.kaggle.com/dell4010/wine-dataset)

#### :construction: Data preparation 
>Cleaning and manipulation of data to be used in the algorithm


#### :mechanical_arm: Train Model 
>Identify the set of trains that will be applied, which techniques will be used, define quality metrics and finally table the accuracy measures of each test.

> Case wine is red(:wine_glass:) are return 0 if wine is white(:cocktail:) are return 1
